Making a simple UI to facilitate ingesting data in the Elastic Stack

Simply open the [easyIngest.html](easyIngest.html) file in your browser. You'll be able to fetch data from an Elasticsearch cluster or simply edit/copy/paste a line in the main bar.

Then drag/drop or double click to select a field (and name it right away, as the focus indicates).
Right click to deselect.
Typing should be automatic.

Finally use the Copy button to grab the configuration file.

Enjoy!
